The extra credit options that I chose to do are....
- The startup ideas textFile where I listed potential startup ideas and how they could be applied
- Adding an Image to my GUI
- Adding color (grey) to my GUI
  - Is a grey background (yes I know my creativity sucks)
- Used ObservableList and ListView, where you can see the ideas that you add to the GUI
